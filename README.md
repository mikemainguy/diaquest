## Getting Started
This project require firebase realtime DB and auth0 to run.  You can firebase install locally using 
[These Instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure).  Alternatively,
if you have your own firebase realtime db already set up, you can configure to use your copy.
RUnning without Auth0 isn't currently supported, but I would welcome a PR to allow safely disabling it.  

## Notably, you're going to need the following things in an .env file.

Once you have those configured, you should be good to go, just run npm start.

Tested Configuration:
Node 14.18.1
Npm 6.14.8
