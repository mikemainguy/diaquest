<h1>We believe that VR/AR enable a new dimension of design thinking and collaborative brainstorming experiences.</h1>
<p>
    With the advent of (reasonably) cost effective VR/XR Head Mounted Displays (HMD), it's now feasible to interact in
    ways that previously were cost prohibitive and/or time consuming.

<h2>Virtual Offices are the worst of all worlds</h2>
<p>
    The current crop of immersive offerings coming from the "app store" scene seem geared toward recreating experiences that:
    <ul>
    <li>sucked to begin with</li>
    <li>are better experienced in real life (IRL), compared to in a virtual synthetic environment</li>
    <li>currently are hampered by "app store" monopolies that, while perhaps good intentioned, destroy the value that the
    internet is designed to provide</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we believe</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Virtual experiences should be designed to be different than what an in person experience offers</li>
    <li>Recreating the real world virtually is a "cool party trick" but mostly a low fidelity recreation of experiences
    that are frankly "better in real life"</li>
    <li>Immersive experiences should provide value by creating physically impossible interactive and creative opportunities</li>
    <li>They should transcend devices and vendors and, in the spirit of the internet, promote a connected and
    interoperable ecosystem.</li>
    <li>You should be able to get lower fidelity versions of immersive experiences on devices ranging from laptops to TVs to cellphones
    without the need for expensive hardware</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Webxr and frameworks built upon it are just the beginning of a new way of building immersive experiences that
    solve real world problems.  Platforms like a-frame are an excellent starting point to bridge the gap between
    the "flat web" and the "immersive web".
